    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is minoesje from the Shanniiwrites forum. This is my page
      for the Shanniwrites coding school! I hope you guys would be able to give
      me some tips on how to improve on my frontend I have been trying to learn
      frontend for 2 years... but it just isn't really working for me. Oh and
      btw, I'm sorry for any spelling mistakes that I might make... Please tell
      me if I made any errors. Again I'm really sorry. To make up for it I will
      show you a picture of my puppy! I hope I placed it right in the coding
      though...

    <p>
      This is Kai! You might have already seen him on the forums somewhere
      because he is my pride and joy! He's born in october last year! This means
      that he's 8 months old! It's a Friese Stabij. I looked it up and in
      english they call him a Frisian pointer, Stabij or stabyhoun. There are
      dutch dogs form Friesland. This is a county in the north of the
      netherlands. The Friese Stabij can become 13 til 14 years old , and they
      are in the colors: Roan , black-white, brown-white and orange-white. A
      full grown male have an avarage height of 53 cm and females have an
      avarage height of 50cm. I got Kai for my 18th birthday this year and we've
      become bestfriends ever since. Kailoves going for long walks and Kai is
      almost always in for a hug! Just recently not so much because it's pretty
